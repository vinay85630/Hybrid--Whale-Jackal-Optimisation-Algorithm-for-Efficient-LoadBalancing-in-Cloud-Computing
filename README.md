🧠 Algorithm Description
Hybrid Whale-Jackal Optimization Algorithm (HWJOA)
The proposed algorithm combines two powerful metaheuristic optimization techniques:

Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA):
Inspiration: Hunting behavior of humpback whales
Strengths: Excellent exploration capabilities
Phases: Encircling prey, bubble-net attacking, search for prey
Golden Jackal Optimization Algorithm (GJO):
Inspiration: Hunting and social behavior of golden jackals
Strengths: Superior exploitation and local search
Mechanisms: Prey stalking, encircling, and pouncing
Hybrid Approach:
The algorithm leverages WOA's exploration in early iterations and transitions to GJO's exploitation for fine-tuning solutions, achieving optimal balance between exploration and exploitation.

📊 Performance Metrics
The algorithm is evaluated using the following key performance indicators:

Makespan: Total execution time for all tasks
Load Balance Factor: Distribution uniformity across VMs
Throughput: Tasks completed per unit time
Response Time: Average task completion time
